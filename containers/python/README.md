# GPUCompare
Compares used GPU prices on eBay with their performance to find the best deal for you

Note: the script is currently working on ebay.com.au, but it should be easily adaptable if you want to use it in other regions.

To run:
- Add chromedriver to the working directory or have it added to PATH
- Use the csv file provided or download and format your own from gpu.userbenchmark.com, the only important part of the file for running is that column 3 is the name of the GPU. The file should be in your working directory.
